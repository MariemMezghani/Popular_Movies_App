## Project Overview

This project is created for my Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree.
The app allows its users to discover the most popular movies playing. It fetches data from the internet with theMovieDB API.

## App features

- Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
- Allow the user to change sort order via a setting:
  - The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
- Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
  - original title
  - movie poster image thumbnail
  - A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
  - user rating (called vote_average in the api)
  - release date
  
## Running the app

This app utilizes the Movie Database API. 
To run this app, you must obtain a free API key from the MovieDB website and insert it in the NetworkUtils.java file where it says
<your_api_key>.
